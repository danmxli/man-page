## Experience

### Voltra Energy â€” Software Developer  
- Delivered systems powering EV-charging and IoT services with an emphasis on concurrent, fault-tolerant services, high-throughput pipelines, and backend security.
    - **IoT Action pipeline**
        - A messaging fabric for Open Charge Point Protocol remote commands, built using Elixir.
        - Implements the actor model for concurrent computation.
        - Zero message loss in chaos tests and process restarts due to automatic state reconstruction of process handlers.
    - **Traffic Management Layer**
        - A multi-cloud policy enforcement gateway, built using Apache APISIX.
        - Features load-balancing, per-tenant rate-limiting, and header-based API-key auth for protected routes.
        - Features an observability pipeline to stream gateway events into Clickhouse for real-time billing & analytics.

### Onlia Insurance - Automation QA
- Led the development of a web automation tool for regression testing workflows.
    - **Selenium POM framework**
        - Implements Java-based Page Object Model design to encapsulate web elements, allowing for a wide scope of testing.
